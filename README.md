## Usage

This calendar is a time sensitive calendar. It starts from 9 AM in the morning to 5 PM in the afternoon. The calendar is set up with the current time with the clock on the header. When it is past time, the time block will trun grey; when it reaches to current time, the time block will be red; And the future times, the time block will be green. Once I put in the note into the time block, it should be saved into the local storage and when I refresh the page, my note should still be there.
